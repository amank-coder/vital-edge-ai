## 🚀 Overview

As awareness of mental health grows, fitness centers often fall short in addressing psychological wellness. Our Smart Health Monitoring System bridges this gap by predicting mental health risks and providing personalized fitness recommendations using AI and machine learning.

---

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ **Mental Health Risk Prediction** using a Random Forest Classifier (Yes/No)
- 🏋️ **Personalized Workout, Diet & Equipment Recommendations**
- 🤖 **AI-Powered JavaScript Chatbot** for real-time user interaction
- 🖥️ **Clean Web Interface** for gym staff to manage and monitor clients
- 📈 **Real-Time Data Flow** between backend and frontend

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS  
- **Chatbot**: JavaScript (Vanilla JS)  
- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier
